## Guess the Weather Game Project

### This project was intended to practice development of web application skills.
### Backend implementation: _Java Spring_
### Relational Database: _MySQL_

#### I think this project represents core logic of a REST api.And it is a good example of fundementals of web developement.

##### How it works:
* User is presented with a Difficulty select box.
* Upon selecting the difficulty a random temperature is assigned with counter of a how many guesses left
* User enters country codes to the field and clicks *guess it!* button.
* If it is a valid guess user wins.
* If it is a invalid guess player gets to guess again until they run out of guesses.
